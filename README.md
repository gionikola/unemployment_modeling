# Unemployment Modeling

This repository contains my replications of various unemployment modeling studies in macroeconomics. 

The `test` folder in the main directory contains a script for each replicated paper that tests out the corresponding code.

Any other given folder in the main directory is associated with an individual paper, and contains all scripts necessary for replicating the paper's results.
